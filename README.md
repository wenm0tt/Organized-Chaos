# Instructions
There are a few installs required for the program to run. If you are on macOS:

```
pip3 install sympy
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install Pillow
```

Otherwise, if you are on Windows:

```
pip install sympy
pip install numpy
pip install Pillow
```
Then run the program. If your command line interpreter doesn't understand a module that is being imported, it is likely fixed by pip-installing the module.
